Forking a repository
You might fork a project to propose changes to the upstream, or original, repository. In this case, it's good practice to regularly sync your fork with the upstream repository. To do this, you'll need to use Git on the command line. You can practice setting the upstream repository using the same octocat/Spoon-Knife repository you just forked.

On GitHub.com, navigate to the octocat/Spoon-Knife repository.
In the top-right corner of the page, click Fork.
